# FreqSynthPCB
A PCB Design for an Si5351A Frequency Synthesiser with Manual Control

This is a PCB I designed for a Si5351a Frequency Synthesiser. It can generate a clock at any arbitrary frequency with 1KHz resolution up to 125MHz.
Control is done using a ATMEGA328-PB. 
There is a rotary encoder to control the frequency at the output, along with an OLED for displaying the selected frequency
